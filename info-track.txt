- [Fixed!] fixing issue: FastText recall is 'nan' but precision is a number. And the soltuion is pip3 install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText.git@b64e359d5485dda4b4b5074494155d18e25c8d13 
- [Done!] fasttext model used to classifiy bug reports (security and non-security labels) 
- [Underprocess] fasttext molde used to tagging the security reports with multiple labels 
- [Underprocess] Calcluate ROC and AUC 
- [Not schedule] writing the methodology section 
- [Done!] on the virtual machine (virtualbox - ubunto) model = fasttext.train_supervised(input="ambari.valid") (not working)
model = fasttext.load_model("model_ambari.bin") (working good)
- [Done!] Precision and Recall values Equals. This is because ""interpretation" of precision and recall in fastText", I am using binary classifications (security and non-security) while in fasttext apparently interprets any classification problem as multi-class.However, we are going to build our own confusion matrix.

- [Done!] it might be useful for Calcluate predictions for kfold: https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/facebook-s-fasttext-algorithm 
- [Done!] confusin matrix is solved hard coded from the model.bin [check the results with other projects]
- [Done!] Precision and Recall are high but ROC and AUC did not show me good results (not satisfied). Useful links to read:

- [Fixed!] Precision and Recall cause problem in wicket project (devided by zero). Discussed here: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/8025/what-are-correct-values-for-precision-and-recall-when-the-denominators-equal-0 
- [Underprocess] writing the paper - Abstract, introduction, related worrk, method, and results.
- [Done!] add more evaluation matrics - g measure, pd and pf 
- [Done!] updated all evalauations for all tested projects
- [Done!] rerun the expermint on wicket project for validation test
